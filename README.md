### About Me:
* Hobby Software Developer
* Trying to create mods for Minecraft Fabric to implement features that I think are missing
* Committed to keeping those mods **open source** in order to foster healthy competition and growth in the modding scene
* Have no clue what I'm actually doing when creating mods
